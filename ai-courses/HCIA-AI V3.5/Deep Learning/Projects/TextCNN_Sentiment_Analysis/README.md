# 📝 TextCNN for Sentiment Analysis

This project delves into Natural Language Processing (NLP) by implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for text classification. Specifically, we use the TextCNN architecture to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews.

---

### 🎯 **Objective**

The main objective is to build and train a TextCNN model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. This project showcases how CNNs, traditionally used for computer vision, can be effectively applied to text data.

### 🛠️ **Key Concepts**

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enabling computers to understand and process human language.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the emotional tone behind a body of text.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Text**: Applying 1D convolutions to extract features from text data.
- **Word Embeddings**: Representing words as dense vectors.
