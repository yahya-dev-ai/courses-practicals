### 🎯 **Objective**

The primary objective is to leverage a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model and fine-tune it for the specific task of flower classification. This demonstrates the power of transfer learning in deep vision.

### 🛠️ **Key Concepts**

- **Deep Learning for Computer Vision**: Using deep neural networks to analyze and understand visual data.
- **Transfer Learning**: Adapting a pre-trained model (MobileNetV2) for a new task.
- **Image Classification**: Categorizing images into predefined classes (in this case, different types of flowers).
